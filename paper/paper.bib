abstract = {We present lenstronomy, a multi-purpose open-source gravitational lens modelling pythonpackage. lenstronomy is able to reconstruct the lens mass and surface brightness distributions of strong lensing systems using forward modelling. lenstronomy supports a wide range of analytic lens and light models in arbitrary combination. The software is also able to reconstruct complex extended sources (Birrer et. al 2015) as well as being able to model point sources. We designed lenstronomy to be stable, flexible and numerically accurate, with a clear user interface that could be deployed across different platforms. Throughout its development, we have actively used lenstronomy to make several measurements including deriving constraints on dark matter properties in strong lenses, measuring the expansion history of the universe with time-delay cosmography, measuring cosmic shear with Einstein rings and decomposing quasar and host galaxy light. The software is distributed under the MIT license. The documentation, starter guide, example notebooks, source code and installation guidelines can be found at https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Gravitationally lensed curved arcs provide a wealth of information about the underlying lensing distortions. Extracting precise lensing information from extended sources is a key component in many studies aiming to answer fundamental questions about the universe. To maintain accuracy with increased precision, it is of vital importance to characterize and understand the impact of degeneracies inherent in lensing observables. In this work, we present a formalism to describe the gravitational lensing distortion effects resulting in curved extended arcs based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the local lensing Jacobian and their directional differentials. We identify a nonlocal and nonlinear extended deflector basis that inherits these local properties. Our parameterization is tightly linked to observable features in extended sources and allows one to accurately extract the lensing information of extended images without imposing an explicit global deflector model. We quantify what degeneracies can be broken based on specific assumptions about the local lensing nature and assumed intrinsic source shape. Our formalism is applicable from the weak linear regime to the semi-linear regime and all the way up to the highly nonlinear regime of highly magnified arcs of multiple images. The methodology and implementation presented in this work provides a framework to assessing systematics, to guide inference efforts in the right choices in complexity based on the data at hand, and to quantify the lensing information extracted in a model-independent way (https://github.com/sibirrer/curved_arcs).}

    abstract = {The free-streaming length of dark matter depends on fundamental dark matter physics, and determines the abundance and concentration of dark matter haloes on sub-galactic scales. Using the image positions and flux ratios from eight quadruply imaged quasars, we constrain the free-streaming length of dark matter and the amplitude of the subhalo mass function (SHMF). We model both main deflector subhaloes and haloes along the line of sight, and account for warm dark matter free-streaming effects on the mass function and mass–concentration relation. By calibrating the scaling of the SHMF with host halo mass and redshift using a suite of simulated haloes, we infer a global normalization for the SHMF. We account for finite-size background sources, and marginalize over the mass profile of the main deflector. Parametrizing dark matter free-streaming through the half-mode mass mhm, we constrain the thermal relic particle mass mDM corresponding to mhm. At \$95 \\, \{\\rm per\\, cent\}\$ CI: mhm \&lt; 107.8 M⊙ (\$m\_\{\\rm \{DM\}\} \\gt 5.2 \\ \\rm \{keV\}\$). We disfavour \$m\_\{\\rm \{DM\}\} = 4.0 \\,\\rm \{keV\}\$ and \$m\_\{\\rm \{DM\}\} = 3.0 \\,\\rm \{keV\}\$ with likelihood ratios of 7:1 and 30:1, respectively, relative to the peak of the posterior distribution. Assuming cold dark matter, we constrain the projected mass in substructure between 106 and 109 M⊙ near lensed images. At \$68 \\, \{\\rm per\\, cent\}\$ CI, we infer \$2.0\{-\}6.1 \\times 10^\{7\}\\, \{\{\\rm M\}\_\{\\odot \}\}\\,\\rm \{kpc^\{-2\}\}\$, corresponding to mean projected mass fraction \$\\bar\{f\}\_\{\\rm \{sub\}\} = 0.035\_\{-0.017\}^\{+0.021\}\$.

The three components, optimization using multistart gradient descent, posterior covariance estimation with variational inference, and sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, all take advantage of gradient information through automatic differentiation and massive parallelization on graphics processing units (GPUs). We test our pipeline on a large set of simulated systems and demonstrate in detail its high level of performance. The average time to model a single system on four Nvidia A100 GPUs is 105 s. The robustness, speed, and scalability offered by this framework make it possible to model the large number of strong lenses found in current surveys and present a very promising prospect for the modeling of  lensing systems expected to be discovered in the era of the Vera C.

  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {Constraining the distribution of small-scale structure in our universe allows us to probe alternatives to the cold dark matter paradigm. Strong gravitational lensing offers a unique window into small dark matter halos (&lt;1010  M ⊙) because these halos impart a gravitational lensing signal even if they do not host luminous galaxies. We create large data sets of strong lensing images with realistic low-mass halos, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observational effects, and galaxy light from HST’s COSMOS field. Using a simulation-based inference pipeline, we train a neural posterior estimator of the subhalo mass function (SHMF) and place constraints on populations of lenses generated using a separate set of galaxy sources. We find that by combining our network with a hierarchical inference framework, we can both reliably infer the SHMF across a variety of configurations and scale efficiently to populations with hundreds of lenses. By conducting precise inference on large and complex simulated data sets, our method lays a foundation for extracting dark matter constraints from the next generation of wide-field optical imaging surveys.}

  title = {A Strong Gravitational Lens Is Worth a Thousand Dark Matter Halos: Inference on Small-scale Structure Using Sequential Methods},
  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {Strong gravitational lenses are a singular probe of the Universe’s small-scale structure—they are sensitive to the gravitational effects of low-mass (&lt;1010 M ⊙) halos even without a luminous counterpart. Recent strong-lensing analyses of dark matter structure rely on simulation-based inference (SBI). Modern SBI methods, which leverage neural networks as density estimators, have shown promise in extracting the halo-population signal. However, it is unclear whether the constraints from these models are limited by the methodology or the data. In this study, we introduce an accelerator-optimized simulation pipeline that can generate lens images with realistic subhalo populations in milliseconds. Leveraging this simulator, we identify the main limitation of our fiducial SBI analysis: training set size. We then adopt a sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) approach, allowing us to refine the training distribution to align with the observed data. Using only one-fifth as many mock Hubble Space Telescope images, SNPE matches the constraints on the low-mass halo population produced by our best nonsequential model. Our experiments suggest that an over 3 order-of-magnitude increase in training set size and GPU hours would be required to achieve an equivalent result without sequential methods. While the full potential of the existing lens sample remains to be explored, the notable improvement in constraining power enabled by our sequential approach highlights that current constraints are limited primarily by methodology and not the data itself. Moreover, our results emphasize the need to treat training set generation and model optimization as interconnected stages of any cosmological analysis using SBI.}
